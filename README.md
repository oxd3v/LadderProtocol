#Ladder Protocol
"$Ladder" is a special token that goes up in value when people buy it, but it doesn't decrease to zero when people sell it because it has a base price. This is because of a modified rebase that happens within the liquidity pool. As more people invest in the liquidity pool, the value of the token will go up in a step-by-step manner.
